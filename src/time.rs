//! RTMP timestamps are 32 byte unsigned integers representing the number of milliseconds from
//! and unknown epoch.
//!
//! Since it's meant to support streams that can go on forever, timestamps have to work with
//! time values that overflow and underflow a 32 bit integer but still be able to do comparisons.
//! To support this the `RtmpTimestamp` struct was created to abstract away the calculations
//! and make it easy to work with RTMP timestamps.
//!
//! According to the RTMP spec, times are adjacent if they are within 2<sup>31</sup> - 1 milliseconds
//! of each other.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Basic arithmetic and comparison support:
//!
//! ```
//! use rml_rtmp::time::RtmpTimestamp;
//!
//! let time1 = RtmpTimestamp::new(10);
//! let time2 = RtmpTimestamp::new(20);
//! let time3 = RtmpTimestamp::new(30);
//! let mut time4 = RtmpTimestamp::new(10);
//!
//! assert!(time1 < time2);
//! assert_eq!(time3, time1 + time2);
//! assert_eq!(time2, time1 + 10);
//!
//! time4.set(30);
//! assert_eq!(RtmpTimestamp::new(30), time4);
//! ```
//!
//! Value Wrapping support:
//!
//! ```
//! use rml_rtmp::time::RtmpTimestamp;
//!
//! let time1 = RtmpTimestamp::new(10000);
//! let time2 = RtmpTimestamp::new(4000000000);
//! let time3 = RtmpTimestamp::new(3000000000);
//!
//! assert!(time1 > time2);
//! assert!(time3 < time2);
//! ```
//!
//! For ease of use, a `RtmpTimestamp` can be directly compared to u32s:
//!
//! ```
//! use rml_rtmp::time::RtmpTimestamp;
//!
//! let time = RtmpTimestamp::new(50);
//!
//! assert!(time < 60);
//! assert!(time > 20);
//! assert!(time == 50);
//! ```
